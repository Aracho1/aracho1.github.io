  <section id="about">
    <h2>Hi, I am</h2>
      <img id="me-photo" src="images/me-photo6.jpg">
      <p>
        from Seoul, Korea. When I turned 15, my family moved to Hanoi, Vietnam where I spent my teenage years in an international school making friends from all over the world.
        After graduating high school, I came to London for my studies and I was immediately drawn to the city's diverse and lively culture.
        I have been working as a business manager in a global bank in the last 5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        About a year ago, I started coding in the evenings and weekends for fun, with the help of my programmer boyfriend.
        Programming has become an increasingly important space for me to learn and be creative.
        I love that coding trains you to be both creative and logical.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working or coding, I love cooking vegan food, practising yoga and running in the parks.

  <section id="why">
    <h2>why I want to be a programmer </h2>
    <h3>constant learning</h3>
    <p>
      I am someone who thrives on being exposed new challenges and learning new things.
      I love that programming challenges me to learn new concepts and codes everyday.
      I know that becoming a programmer is a journey of constantly learning new codes, concepts and technology, which excites me.
    </p>
    <h3>problem solving</h3>
    <p>
      I love the exhilarating moment when I finally figure out how to solve a problem I have been working on for a long time.
      The process can be slow and frustrating but persistence and hard work often leads to a result.
    </p>
    <h3>making an impact</h3>
    <p>
      What I truly love about programming is that I can see something I created come to life.
      It is an empowering skill and feeling to see a code changing things even if it is something small.
      I would love to build or contribute something through programming that makes a positive impact in people's lives.
